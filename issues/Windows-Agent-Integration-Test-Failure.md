### Windows Agent Integration Test Failure

The Windows Agent integration test has failed three times in a row, being cancelled after 6 hours due to incomplete execution. Error logs indicate that expected logs are not being generated.

Please compare the current code (functionality and tests) with version 4.14.0 Alpha 1 to identify the cause of this issue and propose a fix, as this is blocking successful Windows Agent testing.
