## Exploratory Test: Agent Behavior on Configuration Changes in Rocky Linux 9

### Objective
Conduct a new exploratory test on Rocky Linux 9 to review the agent's behavior when configuration changes affect the wazuh-agentd process (such as `<client_buffer>`) or other processes (`<syscheck>`, `<localfile>`, `<sca>`, `<active-response>`).

### Scope
- Verify that changes to the buffer configuration are applied as expected.
- Confirm that when configuration changes occur, the following daemons are restarted: `wazuh-modulesd`, `wazuh-execd`, `wazuh-syscheckd`, and `wazuh-logcollector`.

### Notes
This test aims to ensure correct application of configuration changes and proper restart of relevant daemons in Rocky Linux 9 environment.
